<p>Itching is a side effect of allopurinol that concerns many gout sufferers. Yet, we know that allopurinol itch is only one of the <a href="https://goutpal.com/blog/is-gout-itchy/">three types of gout itch</a>. Furthermore, skin-related side effects of allopurinol are well-documented. But allopurinol also has a recognized role in helping itchy skin.</p>
<h2 id="topics">Allopurinol &amp; Itching Research Topics</h2>
<p>Here, I review 4 studies about {{ topic }}. Including, 2 cases of allopurinol causing itching. Then, 2 cases of allopurinol relieving itching.</p>
<h3 id="overdose">Allopurinol Overdose &amp; Itching</h3>
<p>My first study is a case report of a chemotherapy patient who started allopurinol at a dose of 300 mg per day. Being three to six times the initiation dose recommended by ACR gout guidelines.</p>
<p>Among other symptoms, this patient experienced extensive itching (pruritus).</p>
<p><code>Taghvaye Masoumi, H., Hadjibabaie, M., Zarif‐Yeganeh, M. and Arasteh, O., 2017. Exacerbation of allopurinol‐induced drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms by teicoplanin: A case report. Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics, 42(5), pp.642-645.</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpt.12556">Seven days after allopurinol initiation, the patient presented with fever (38.7&nbsp;°C), dyspnea, shortening of breath, facial edema, generalized pruritus, erythema and macular rash affecting the face, abdomen, trunk, upper and lower limbs, which involved more than 50% of the body surface area</q></p>
<h3 id="rash">Allopurinol Rash &amp; Itching</h3>
<p>My second study describes similar symptoms. But with no details of the allopurinol dose that caused the itchy rash. I've used a photograph from this study as the featured image for this review.</p>
<p><code>Zemmez, Y. and Hjira, N., 2018. Allopurinol-induced DRESS syndrome: drug reaction with eosynophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). The Pan African Medical Journal, 30, pp.120-120.</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2018.30.120.15854">We report the case of a 60-year-old patient with a 1-month history of hyperuricemia treated with allopurinol. The patient presented to the Department of Dermatology with acute rash on the face and the lower limbs […] Lesions were very itchy with burning sensation (B).</q></p>
<h3 id="skin">Allopurinol Reduces Skin Disease Itching</h3>
<p>My third study reveals that allopurinol can reduce itching in some skin diseases.</p>
<p><code>Lukács, J., Schliemann, S. and Elsner, P., 2018. Treatment of acquired reactive perforating dermatosis–a systematic review. JDDG: Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft, 16(7), pp.825-842.</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.1111/ddg.13561">The acquired reactive perforating dermatosis (ARPD) is a frequent and severely itchy condition that develops in adults, particularly among patients with diabetes and its complications such as renal failure […] Allopurinol may be a valid and helpful treatment. Its exact mechanism of action is unknown: it may act via its antioxidant effect [6] via inhibition of xanthine oxidase [2, 3, 31, 35]. In the case reports covered by this review, no side effects were observed under allopurinol treatment.</q></p>
<h3 id="psoriasis">Allopurinol Reduces Psoriasis Itching</h3>
<p>My final study investigates psoriasis, another common skin disease. Researchers determined several causes of chronic itch. Including antacids, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin enzyme converting inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Whereas allopurinol was one of the best ways to reduce chronic itch.</p>
<p><code>Reszke, R., Białynicki-Birula, R. and Szepietowski, J.C., 2019. Itch in Psoriasis: A New Look at Well-known Subject. Acta Dermato-Venereologica, 99(4).</code></p>
<p><q cite="https://doi.org/10.2340/00015555-3147">chronic itch was positively correlated with the use of antacids, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin enzyme converting inhibitors, beta-blockers, xerosis intensity and Physician’s Global Assessment score, whereas psychiatric drugs other than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, allopurinol, coexistence of arterial hypertension and application of emollients acted conversely.</q></p>
